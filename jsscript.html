                For thousands of years the mysterious island of Aeternum has been the source of fantastical legends—and
                now you’ve found it. Shipwrecked, with no supplies or allies, you’ll need to make your way in a
                dangerous world where the fundamental laws of life and death don’t apply.
                <code>
                    var y = 20.
                </code>
            </p>
            <p>
                <code>ley y = 15.</code>
                Magic flows through Aeternum. It brings life: miraculous healing, reanimation of the dead, and strange
                flora with magical properties. And it brings horror: the power to cause untold destruction and the slow
                wasting of the soul through countless cycles of death and resurrection.
            </p>
            <p>
                In such a land, your destiny is whatever you make of it.
                <code>
                    const PI = 3.14;
                </code>

                As you journey, you'll find creatures, plants, stones, and other resources that have been altered by the
                magic of Aeternum. Most important is the precious Azoth, a strange blue substance that seems to be magic
                given form.

                Wretched once-human creatures, twisted by centuries of death and revival, infest Aeternum—the Corrupted,
                the Ancient, and the Lost. They and the Angry Earth, strange beings that seem more plant than animal,
                each have their own plans for the island and its magic.

                Aeternum's mysteries run as deep and dark as its history. Delve into the world and uncover the secret
                truth of the island and its millennia of strange inhabitants.
